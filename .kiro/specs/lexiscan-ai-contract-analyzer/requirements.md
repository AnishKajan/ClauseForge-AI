# Requirements Document

## Introduction

LexiScan is an enterprise-grade AI platform that helps lawyers, compliance officers, and businesses analyze, compare, and summarize contracts using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered by pgvector, LangChain, and Claude. The system automatically extracts key clauses, detects risks, and answers natural-language questions about uploaded documents while supporting both individual users and enterprise organizations with SSO, billing tiers, and shared workspaces.

5. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL update document status and notify the user
6. WHEN a document is stored THEN metadata (filename, uploader, upload time, hash) SHALL be logged in the documents table
7. WHEN upload fails or file type is unsupported THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error and rollback storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want to ask natural language questions about uploaded contracts and receive accurate answers with citations, so that I can quickly find specific information without reading entire documents.

4. WHEN providing answers THEN the system SHALL include page-level citations with line/page IDs
5. WHEN citations are provided THEN the system SHALL allow users to highlight and navigate to referenced sections
6. WHEN models are invoked THEN the system SHALL support configurable model selection (Claude 3 Sonnet / Opus) per plan and region

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want automated compliance checks run on my contracts, so that I can identify missing clauses and potential risks before signing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a document analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL run rule-based compliance checks
2. WHEN compliance checks execute THEN the system SHALL identify missing indemnity clauses, liability caps, and other critical elements
3. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL load organization-specific playbook JSON and compute risk score
4. WHEN risk assessment finishes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed summary with recommendations

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL provide Free/Trial tier with 50 pages per month
2. WHEN a user upgrades to Pro THEN the system SHALL allow 1500 pages plus AI Q&A limits
3. WHEN enterprise features are needed THEN the system SHALL offer custom limits, SSO, and priority queue
4. WHEN usage limits are reached THEN the system SHALL notify users and restrict further processing
5. WHEN billing events occur THEN the system SHALL handle Stripe webhooks for usage metering
6. WHEN Stripe webhook delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 5
